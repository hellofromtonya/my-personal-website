			<dt>Am I a freelancer?</dt>
			<dd>Nope. I'm not for hire as a contractor.</dd>
			<dt>Am I seeking employment?</dt>
			<dd>Possibly.  If we are aligned and you believe I would be a good fit, then I'm open to discussing the opportunity with you.  Please note, that I am a leader and not a hands-on engineer these days.  Therefore, I am not seeking a developer or engineer position.  Rather, I am more interested in management, leadership, and/or teaching.  I really dig building teams, documentation, delighting clients, and supporting and advocating for developers and communities.</dd>
			<dt>What powers me?</dt>
			<dd>I'm powered by hot lemon-water and a burning desire to contribute to the betterment of our lives.</dd>
			<dt>What is my favorite color?</dt>
			<dd>Green</dd>
			<dt>Do I do public speaking?</dt>
			<dd>Yes, I love speaking.  However, I do not travel.  Therefore, the event must either be virtual or close to NE Wisconsin, where we live.</dd>
			<dt>Why don't I travel?</dt>
			<dd>In the first 22 years of my career, I spent months and years on the road as we deployed the automated systems we built.  When you build mega-million dollar systems, the deployment time and then subsequent training and transition times exponentially increase.  If a project took a year to build, then I was on the road for at least ten months.  In Chapter 3 of my life, I do not want to be in hotels or on the road. Period.</dd>
			<dt>Do I privately tutor or do corporate training?</dt>
			<dd>Nope. At Know the Code, I am focusing on teaching as many people as I can.  Tutoring, mentoring, and private consulting require focusing on one person or a small group of people.  That takes my time away from teaching the community, as I want to provide betterment opportunities for as many people as I can.</dd>
