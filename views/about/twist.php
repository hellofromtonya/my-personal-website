		<h2 class="section--title">A Twist to My Story</h2>
		<p>I'm in Chapter 3 of my life.  The first chapter was my childhood and then engineering career in the high-tech automated manfacturing industry.  Then life threw me a curve ball, one that devastated our lives and redefined who I am.  My story is not for the faint-of-heart, but one of miracles, hope, humility, and happiness.</p>
		<p>I wrote an essay on <a href="https://heropress.com/essays/finding-your-purpose-in-life/">HeroPress</a> that tells my story in more vivid detail. In 2007, my world changed forever. I became ill, so ill that it disabled me.  Each day I fought for survival and required constant care. In 2013, my body gave up.  I spent 32 days in the Intensive Care Unit (ICU).  On New Year's Day, while everyone was toasting the new year and what amazing things lied before them, I passed away.</p>
		<p>I received a miracle that day.  When I awoke, the pain was gone.  I amazed my medical team as I went from death to a full recovery.  Since that day, I've not had one headache or issue.  I truly received a miracle.  I am forever changed by it.</p>
		<p>For you to know me, you must know my story.  The agony I went through and then my miracle shaped how I think and what I believe.  I'm blessed to have been given the opportunity to share, contribute, and teach.  In this third chapter of my life, I am giving back.</p>
