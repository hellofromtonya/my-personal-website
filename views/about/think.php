		<h2 class="section--title">I like to rethink and ask "Why"</h2>
		<p>I like to rethink the way we do things to find a better path, one that is more efficient, effective, leads us forward, and is balanced with the intent. I like to share ideas, plant seeds, and inspire you to consider a different approach. I like innovation and forward-thinking. My blog is all about the way I think. It’s meant to inspire you to stop, assess, and rethink.</p>
		<h2>How do I think?</h2>
		<p>I’ve always had a knack for seeing the big picture and questioning “why” and “how.” It’s my nature to ponder and think about other alternatives. Many times I’ll look at a process, product, or site and think “hum why did s/he do it this way and how can we improve this?”</p>
		<p>I’m a motivator, thought leader, and teacher. Yes, I’m an engineer too. But I like thinking of new ways and then planting the seeds to get you to think differently and move you from where you are to something better and bigger.</p>
