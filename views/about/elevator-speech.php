		<p>Hello I’m Tonya. The essence of my 30-year career has been unlocking potential.  I can see what is possible, that something which does not currently exist, but could.  My creed is to create a vision that moves people and inspires them to want to bring it to reality.</p>
        <p>Here is a quick list of what I believe in.  You can read my <a href="https://hellofromtonya.com/manifesto">manifesto</a> for the complete list:</p>
        <ul class="list--indent">
            <li>creating environments which empower people to happily maximize, grow, and achieve;</li>
            <li>the long game, focusing on the end result to build a sustainable future;</li>
            <li>excellence and providing the very best solutions for our clients, market, and people;</li>
            <li>sharing knowledge and creating environments where knowledge flows freely;</li>
            <li>making a difference, as we give so much to our work.  It needs to mean something for all.</li>
        </ul>
		<p>What motivates and drives me is creating betterment opportunities. Whatever my role, those moments when you <span class="quote__left">I paint pictures and draw roadmaps to show you what is possible.</span>influence a positive shift are exhilarating.</p>
		<p>You can read my <a href="https://hellofromtonya.com/assets/cv/v0701201701/TonyaMork-EducatorCV.pdf">professional CV</a> and see my achievements. Yes, I’ve done cool stuff in my career like leading multi-disciplined teams in mega-million dollar programs, building my elite engineering firm, and solving complex, elusive problems for clients.  But these do not tell you my whole story or share the essence of me.</p>
		<p>How do I achieve results? It’s about being bold, fearless, adaptive, collaborative, inspiring, and innovative. It’s about painting and framing a vivid picture to show people what they could achieve and why it helps them.  We get things done with people who are happily aligned to the mission and vision.  That’s how I get results.  That’s how we transform.</p>
