		<h2 class="section--title title--left">You and I, as Professionals</h2>
		<p>All of the above beliefs apply to us professionals too, as they define who we are as individuals.</p>

		<h3>Forever Explorers</h3>
		<p>I believe we are explorers, forever seeking new ways to improve and innovate. You and I, we create new possibilities, that which is not here right now.  We explore new methodologies and techniques to see what will improve our efficiency and effectiveness. We are forever exploring.</p>

		<h3>Forever Students</h3>
		<p>I believe we are forever students.  Technology changes rapidly.  We must be forever curious, pushing ourselves to learn and grow.  We must smartly focus on building our proficiencies and productivity, while avoiding the barrage of buzz noise. We are forever students of life and technology.</p>

		<h3>Smartly Efficient</h3>
		<p>I believe we are responsible to work smartly and be efficient.  We tweak our workflows to better serve our needs.  We know not to adjust that which serves us well.  We know that there are different approaches and stackups that we can use; however, we are smart and know to pick a path and stick with it.</p>
		<p>We know that our apps, frameworks, and libraries are just tools to help us be more efficient.  We are smart and select that which will help us to achieve that goal.  We are productive.</p>

		<h3>Craftsmen</h3>
		<p>I believe you and I want to do the very best job we can.  We seek to build high quality, clean solutions that are resuable, readable, and maintainable.  We know that those three attributes drive down costs and make it easier for our team and us to work together.</p>
		<p>Our code is a direct reflect our proficiencies and professionalism.  It tells a story.  Anyone reading it should know the story it tells.  Seek to build quality and seek learning how to improve your code.</p>

		<h3>Simplifiers</h3>
		<p>In life, simple is better.  It means less code to build and maintain.  It means you are focused on thinking about the user's needs and finding simple interfaces to let them do what they need to it.  It means when there's already a simple solution that works, we do not need to over-engineer it or re-create something.</p>
		<p>I believe in the KISS (Keep It Simple Stupid) principle.  I believe you and I are simplifiers.</p>

		<h3>Collaborators</h3>
		<p>I believe you and I are collaborators.  We work on teams and with a community.  We know how to communicate with one another, respecting each other's opinions, and taking the best solutions for the betterment of the project.</p>

		<h3>Get over yourself. Ego-free</h3>
		<p>I believe we are at the top of our game when we get over ourselves and live/work ego-free.  Egos, and the constant need to feed the monster, gets in the way of everything.  It inhibits creativity, team building, innovation, and collaboration.  It divides.</p>
		<p>I know this is a tough attribute, as we are human.  But in the workplace, we must put our egos aside and work together for the betterment of the project and team.  You and I need to think about the team, client, and project before ourselves.  When we do, we will contribute to delighting our bosses and clients.</p>
		<p>And remember, just because you didn't build it doesn't mean it isn't a good solution.  Be open and collaborative.  There are many different ways to solve the same problem.</p>

		<h3>Contributors & Knowledge Sharers</h3>
		<p>You and I have unique experience, expertise, and knowledge.  We are good citizens and contribute to the betterment of our communities and profession.  We share our knowledge and help one another.  We mentor others. We roll up our sleeves and contribute to open source projects.  You and I are a part of the developer community.</p>

		<h3>Intuitive Interfaces Builders</h3>
		<p>If I have to read the manual to know how to use the product, the interface is wrong.  Build intuitive interfaces that are self-supporting and self-serving.  Empower the user to be successful on his/her own.</p>
		<p>Reduce the steps. Build in help and knowledge. Guide them with valuable insights tailored just for them.  Be smart.  The interface directly impacts the success of your product.</p>
