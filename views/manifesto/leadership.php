		<h2 class="section--title title--left">Leadership</h2>
		<p>All of the above beliefs apply for leadership too, as we cannot separate the person from business.</p>

		<h3>Lead By Example</h3>
		<p>Our character and who we are at the core of us is how we lead.  Our ability to live the human attributes listed above directly impacts our ability to lead, inspire, move, and motivate people.</p>
		<p>I believe in an effective, visionary, and charismatic leader is one who embodies integrity, kindness, humility, and excellence.  Our behaviors, words, and actions show those around us whether they should believe in our vision or not.  People need to believe in us and trust that what we see is obtainable.</p>

		<h3>People-Centric Culture</h3>
		<p>I believe in a people-centric culture over a project-centric environment.  Projects are things with a short lifespan.  They are short term and can follow a set of guidelines.  They are measureable and controllable. Why? Because they are just things.</p>
		<p>People are not projects.  They do not react or respond like projects.  You cannot manage them like you do a project.</p>
		<p>People are feeling and emotional beings that need to be fulfilled in order to motivate them. They need to feel connected, engaged, and valued.  When they do, they will innovate more, be more loyal, and amaze you and your clients.  Build happy teams.</p>

		<h3>Build the Best Teams</h3>
		<p>In order to be competitive in an ever changing market, you need the best individuals on your team, those who are aligned to your mission and vision. Period.</p>
		<p>You need to find talent, which means you need a wide pool of prospects.  Distributed, remote teams give you that pool.  It opens up boundaries, as the density of your physical geographic location is small.  Remote allows you to scan the world for the best talent that fits into your organization.</p>
		<p>I believe in investing heavily into your teams and each individual. Grow them. Give back to them.  Build happy teams and amaze your clients.</p>

		<h3>Obstacle Seekers</h3>
		<p>I believe a leader seeks obstacles, those inhibitors that impede productivity and growth.  We measure, analyze, and rectify each obstacle to empower our processes and teams.</p>
		<p>Any process that does not support and increase our team's productivity must be retooled or even scraped.  We seek the input from our teams and then lead the effort to ensure that all systems and processes directly support our mission and teams.</p>

		<h3>Share the Vision</h3>
		<p>I believe a leader must communicate and share his/her vision.  Leaders dream.  We are visionaries who see what could be, something that is not present now. We see the potential and possibilities.  Gifted leaders know how to effectively transfer our vision to our teams in order for it to become a reality.  Share the vision.</p>
		<p>Then empower and unleash your teams to go build it and amaze your customers.</p>

		<h3>Think and Be Proactive</h3>
		<p>I believe leaders must be thinking many steps ahead in order to foresee the path and consider alternatives.  We must be proactive and not reactive.  Our jobs are to build a proactive culture and ensure the processes support it fully.</p>

		<h3>Boldly Innovate</h3>
		<p>We, as the technology professionals, invent, innovate, and improve.  We drive technology.  As leaders, it's our jobs to think big and bold.  We must then be smart enough to visualize a roadmap to bring it to reality and bold enough to make it happen.  Share that vision.  Let your teams breathe life into it.</p>

		<h3>Amaze Clients</h3>
		<p>I believe successful businesses continuously amaze clients.  As a leader, it's our job to push the boundaries and seek opportunities to delight our users and customers.</p>

		<h3>Know Your Users</h3>
		<p>You are building something for a population of users.  These are the people who will interact with your product or service.  Know your user.  Know what they want and need.  Know how they use the interfaces.  Build for the user.</p>
		<p>Get out there and interact with your users.  Be a good citizen of the world and lead by your actions.  Be supportive, kind, and overly helpful.</p>
