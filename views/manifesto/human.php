		<h3>Live and let live</h3>
		<p>I believe in the right for each of us to live how we choose, as long as we do not hurt another person.</p>
		<p>It is not for me to say how you should live your life. Nor is it yours to pass judgement or laws on me.  I believe in that right.</p>
		<p>When we live by the creed of kindness, integrity, respect, and humility, we value others and work for the betterment of our world.  Our personal, private lives are ours.  We decide what we want to do and how we should do it. We should have the right to choose for ourselves. But what we choose and how we live must never harm another person.</p>

		<h3>Kindness</h3>
		<p>Kindness is a gift we can share with each person we meet.  It ripples and spreads quickly, propagating to build a gentler world.  It’s our responsibility to extend our hands and lift another up.</p>

		<h3>Integrity</h3>
		<p>Our words and actions affect those around us.  Each word that you utter influences another person.  Words have power. They can lift someone or tear them down.  How you live your life, conduct your business, or interact in your world shows others who you are.  Live with integrity. Be of good character. Be honest and sincere.</p>

		<h3>Humility</h3>
		<p>A humble person values the needs of others.  You value a mission, movement, idea, and life.  Your focus is not on the obtainment of stuff or position, or power.  It’s not focused on how to make yourself more dominant or important.  A humble person is not one to measure a person by how they look.</p>
		<p>Humility fosters a kind, generous, and respectful world.  I seek to humbly serve.</p>

		<h3>Respect, even when we do not agree</h3>
		<p>Every human being has value. Each person has a different perspective that is uniquely his or hers.  We combine our differences to make a better community and world.  But it requires each of us to respect one another.</p>

		<h3>Contributing to the betterment of our world</h3>
		<p>Our world is dependent upon each of us actively contributing to it.  We have the power to shape what it is and how it affects us.  I believe in making it a better place for all.</p>

		<h3>Education for all</h3>
		<p>Knowledge gives us power, unlocks our potential, and stimulates our creativity.  Education is our mechanism to spread knowledge.  The power of education is not just to pass history onto one another.  It’s the sharing of ideas and inspiring each of us to think, explore, and consider.  When we learn, we are making the information our own, adapting it for our perception and realities.  It becomes a part of us.</p>
		<p>Each mind deserves free education.  Our world needs each of us to contribute.  I believe each human being is bright, capable, and full of opportunity and potential.  It’s our duty to cultivate and make education available for all.</p>

		<h3>Open, secure, innovative, and inclusive technology and science</h3>
		<p>You and I may be at different ends of the world, but we are connected together.  Technology and science provide the means for us to communicate, share ideas, and learn from one another.  The internet is the medium that connects us all together.  We have access to incredibly amounts of information. We can do business throughout the world because of it.  Knowledge is at our fingertips simply by exploration.  The internet lets us travel throughout our world to places we would likely never physically go.</p>
		<p>Ours is a technological world.  It impacts our lives from streamlining our favorite television shows to email to video conferencing and to live conferences.  We bank online. We learn online. We shop online. We do business online.  The internet enriches our lives.</p>
		<p>I am a woman of science. I believe in technology and innovation. It’s our responsibility to ensure our advances are stable, secure, and safe.  Privacy, security, and safety are not optional.  STEM should be inclusive regardless of your gender, religion, color, beliefs, orientation, the way you look, or the clothes you wear.</p>
		<p>I believe our lives are better through innovation. Let’s make it available and safe for all.  And let’s make it inclusive for all to contribute.  And I believe in a free internet, as this is our global public resource. Period.</p>

		<h3>Silliness and laughter</h3>
		<p>Humans need to play. We need to laugh and release the negativity in our lives.  Being silly was so easy when we were children.  Somewhere along the way, we locked that part of ourselves away.  Through our play, we were creative.  We saw our world through different eyes.</p>
		<p>I want that playful, silly, creative, imaginative, and funny side of you to live and breathe.  Let him or her out.  I believe in the power of laughter to heal our souls, lift us up over our challenges and pains, and unite us together.</p>
		<p>And even when I was lying in the ICU on life support, I made the medical staff laugh.  Laughter made all of us feel better.  Imagine a world where we can laugh and play together, not at the expense of someone, but in harmony.  I believe in childlike laughter and play.</p>
		<p>Let’s be utterly silly.  Believe me. It will help you to feel happy.</p>

		<h3>I believe in you.</h3>
		<p>I believe you have great potential. I know you are creative, innovative, funny, and insightful.  No matter who you are, where you live, or what you believe in, I believe in you.</p>
